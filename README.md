## User Stories

### Feature 1: Filter Events by City

#### User Story
As a user I should be able to filter the events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city

#### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: When a user has not searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.**

- Given a user has not searched for a city,
- When the user opens the app,
- Then the user should see all upcoming events from all cities.

**Scenario 2: A user should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.**

- Given a user wants to see all upcoming events in a specific city,
- When the user starts typing in the search bar,
- Then the user should see a list of suggestions of cities.

**Scenario 3: A user can select a city from the suggested list.**

- Given a user types the name of a city in the input field,
- When the list of suggestions appears,
- Then the user can select that city for detailed view of events.

### Feature 2: Show/hide an event's details

#### User Story:
As a user, I should be able to show or hide an event's details so that I can see what an event is all about or hide that information. 

#### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default**

- Given the app is loaded
- When the list of events is displayed

**Scenario 3: A user can collapse an event to hide its details**

- Given the event element has been expanded to show details
- When the user clicks on the "Hide Details" button for an event
- Then the event element will collapse to hide its details 

### Feature 3: Specify number of events

#### User Story: 
As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events, so that I can see just how many events are going on in my city of choice.

#### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: When a user has not specified a number of events, 32 is the default number**

- Given the user has loaded the app
- When the user has not specified a number of events
- Then the default number of events is 32

**Scenario 2: A user can change the number of events they want to see**

- When the user changed the number of events they want to see
- Then the app renders the specified number of events

### Feature 4: The app is available when offline

#### User Story:
As a user, I want to use the app when offline, so that I can see a list of events when when I do not have an internet connection

#### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Show cached data when there is no internet connection**

- Given the user is offline
- When the user opens the app
- Then the cached data is displayed

**Scenario 2: Show an alert when a user is offline**

- Given the user is offline
- When the user opens the app
- Then an alert will show to notify the user about the missing internet connection

### Feature 5: Data visualization

#### User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to see a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city, so that I can get a better idea about how many events are taking place in that city
